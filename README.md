## üîß Installation

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Arctic Fox or newer
- Android SDK 31 or higher
- Kotlin 1.7.20 or higher

### Setup

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wifi-signal-mapper.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd wifi-signal-mapper

# Open with Android Studio and sync Gradle files
```

## üì± Usage

### Scanning Wi-Fi Signals

1. Launch the app and grant the required location permissions
2. Enter a descriptive name for your current location (e.g., "Living Room")
3. Tap the "Scan" button to begin scanning for Wi-Fi signals
4. The app will display a color-coded matrix representing signal strengths:
   - **Green**: Strong signal
   - **Yellow**: Medium signal
   - **Red**: Weak signal

### Saving Locations

- After scanning, tap "Save" to store the current scan with the specified location name
- Saved locations appear in the list below and can be selected for detailed viewing

### Comparing Locations

- Toggle the "Compare" switch to view a side-by-side comparison of all saved locations
- Compare signal distribution patterns and access point information across different areas

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Kotlin** - Primary programming language
- **Jetpack Compose** - Modern toolkit for building native UI
- **Material Design 3** - Latest design system from Google
- **StateFlow** - For reactive state management
- **Android Wi-Fi APIs** - For accessing Wi-Fi functionality



### Signal Visualization Algorithm

The app uses a 10√ó10 matrix to represent signal strength measurements:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun SignalMatrixVisualization(
    signals: List<Int>,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier
) {
    val normalizedSignals = remember(signals) {
        // Normalize signals to 0-100 range for visualization
        val minSignal = signals.minOrNull() ?: -100
        val maxSignal = signals.maxOrNull() ?: -30
        val range = max(1, abs(maxSignal - minSignal))

        signals.map { signal ->
            (((signal - minSignal).toFloat() / range) * 100).coerceIn(0f, 100f)
        }
    }
    
    // Drawing logic for the matrix visualization
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Scanning**: The app minimizes battery usage by managing scan frequencies
- **Reactive UI**: Updates are pushed to the UI only when data changes
- **Edge-to-Edge Design**: Full support for notch/cutout areas on modern devices

## üìù Implementation Details

This project demonstrates:

1. **Permission Handling**: Proper implementation of runtime permissions for location access
2. **Jetpack Compose UI**: Modern declarative UI with Material Design 3
3. **MVVM Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with ViewModel pattern
4. **Hardware Integration**: Direct interaction with device Wi-Fi hardware
5. **StateFlow**: Reactive programming approach for UI updates
6. **Edge-to-Edge Design**: Support for modern device form factors
